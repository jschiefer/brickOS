<BLOCKQUOTE>We are working on this release because we enjoy using <font color="#800000"><b>brickOS</b></font> and 
  wish to help it to continue to be improved. We want to have fun putting 
  together this release. We are working on the next level of *fun* for all
  brickOS 
  users. To this end we are stating the following <FONT 
  color=#800000>Desires</FONT> so we know what we are signing up for. We are 
  stating the <FONT color=#800000>Constraints</FONT> so we know what we are not 
  doing and we state the <FONT color=#800000>Issues</FONT> so we can make a 
  first determination for each of them so we are enabled to work towards 
  delivering a successful release.<A name=desires>
  <H3><FONT color=#800000>NEWS</FONT></H3></A>We've released legOS-0.2.6 - a tiny 
  interim release which served to formalize the CVS content which contained a 
  number of bug fixes against 0.2.5.
  <P>We are working on our next major release: brickos-1.0.0
  <P><BR><A name=desires>
  <FONT color=#800000>Desires</FONT></A>
  <p>There are some things that we 
  immediately, as users of 0.2.5, wished we had. Let's address these wishes. 
  Likewise, we have the benefit of University-level study and experimentation 
  against the legOS interrupt handling/servicing. We should seriously evaluate 
  and then apply (if it meets our goals/constraints) the interrupt servicing 
  mechanism patches. We need to freshen our existing documentation. We also have 
  been working on internal comment styles so that we can use Doxygen to generate 
  the brickOS API reference automatically, let's release this. And last but not 
  least this will be our first release under our new name.
  <P>With all of this we have to remember that this is an embedded system, so we 
  have serious physical constraints. Any memory we absorb for use by the OS we 
  remove from program download space, we have to be deliberate in our growth of
  brickOS. 
  <H4>Functional Desires</H4>In more specific terms here is our first cut as 
  what we think this next release is:
  <UL>
    <LI>We need to move to our new name brickOS 
    <LI>Support for the simplified messaging RCX to RCX that was in the earlier 
    releases of legOS 
    <LI>Support for the Universal Remote. It's an invaluable construction test 
    aid 
    <LI>Faster interrupt servicing with less interrupt loss 
    <LI>Support for some of our favorite 3rd party sensors/mux's, etc. 
    <LI>C++ support for any new equip. we support in C (let's not leave our C++ 
    users behind) and vice versa. 
    <LI>Richer programming examples (working examples from projects we've built 
    from the LEGO Mindstorms(™) books, multi-tasking examples in C and some in 
    C++, etc.) 
    <LI>C only legOS library (API) reference (extracted from source code using 
    Doxygen) 
    <LI>C/C++ legOS library (API) reference (extracted from source code using 
    Doxygen) 
    <LI>Revised distribution shape appropriate to our two forms of users: (1) 
    those who want to hack/enhance the kernel, and (2) those who simply want to 
    program the RCX. (read this as we should have 'make distrib' target's and 
    'make install' targets. For a number of reasons one of which is that we are 
    closer to normal Linux projects) </LI></UL>
  <H4>Sources of material under consideration</H4>We have 10 patches that I have 
  found, We need more examples, we have new content in CVS not yet released, we 
  have bugs reported at sourceforge site - some at lugnet site, and there is 
  probably more desirable content we have not yet identified.
  <P>Here's the list of patches I know of and the current status:
  <OL>

      <LI><B><I>Determined to not meet our criteria, this not entering 
      release</I></B> </LI></UL></LI></OL>We need more examples and sample code. I'm 
  thinking we each have favorites we would like to see added. Let's all email 
  our suggestions. This can be suggestions for example's you feel we need and it 
  can be examples you feel you can contribute. Where we have duplicate offers of 
  contribution the people offering the duplicates will decide who's should be 
  submitted.
  <P>I'm thinking that existing CVS content should be made ready for release and 
  then it along with any patches we select should be merged together to produce 
  the latest new code in CVS. I will probably do this merge outside of CVS using 
  commercial tools available to me but then will version the results in CVS so 
  we can work to test and repair issues found in CVS from this point forward. 
  Lastly, we'll release only from CVS.
  <P>What else should we add? [See the related item under the heading 
  "Issues"]<A name=constraints>
  <H3><FONT color=#800000>Constraints</FONT></H3></A>Prior to 0.2.6 we've been 
  without a release for about a year and a half. IMHO I think we need to keep 
  this focused so we can get this release out quickly and then work on the next. 
  So here's a proposal to keep us moving: 
  <UL>
    <LI>This release should build and run with our existing gcc/g++ (egcs) and 
    binutils. Let's take on a newer compiler next release. Maybe the next 
    release is tiny in content (bugfixes?) so that we can concentrate on testing 
    against the next version of the compiler and adjusting legOS to work with 
    it. 
    <LI>Let's use as much of what's already written (offered as patches) so that 
    we suffer as little waiting on new development as possible. 
    <LI>We should roll to the new name for all legOS <B>site content</B> but 
    we'll probably defer the <B>site change</B> (sourceforge project change), if 
    we need to do this, until after this release 
    <LI>(I can't stress this enough ;-) We have serious physical constraints. 
    Any memory we absorb for use by the OS we remove from program download 
    space. Let's be careful in what we choose to do. 
    <LI>Let's keep our code base clean. Watch how we add code, keep the style in 
    which you are writing as similar as you can to what's already there. Clean 
    up around the area, continue to move toward our Doxygen comments where ever 
    we still need to (whenever what you commenting needs to show up in the API 
    reference), etc. </LI></UL><A name=issues>
  <H3><FONT color=#800000>OPEN Issues</FONT></H3></A>I'm sure there are more 
  (please tell me and I'll add them) but here's what I see so far:
  <UL>
    <LI>We need to choose a <B>new name</B>. I'm thinking: 
    <UL>
      <LI>one more round of name gathering (period TBD, two weeks?) 
      <LI>a simple email vote for each persons top three 
      <LI>then sum of the votes tells the winner. 
      <LI>--&gt; Any counter proposals? </LI></UL>
    <LI>So far I've only identified what I know to need attention or which 
    exists. There's other great work out there, we need to identify it to each 
    other in order to consider it for inclusion.&nbsp; I'm thinking:
    <UL>
      <LI>We have a period of open submissions (Period TBD, week or month?) 
      <LI>Then we decide? </LI></UL>
    <LI>The <B>priority interrupt patch</B> will take some effort to apply to 
    0.2.5 
    <UL>
      <LI>This needs to be studied in some depth 
      <LI>Is this a couple of us or how should we handle it? 
      <LI>At the very least we need to read the document they wrote (9 pages or 
      so) which describes the benefits and kernel size differences and then 
      build a version and try it and then we can decide more fairly? </LI></UL>
    <LI>We need to quickly identify first sources of contribution so that it can 
    all be <B>merged into CVS</B> (carefully) so most of our release preparation 
    will happed directly in CVS 
    <UL>
      <LI>This is one of our most looming early concerns. </LI></UL>
    <LI>We've had a request to try to solve the build-a-kernel to create unique 
    ID for LNP issue. Let's get this in this release. 
    <LI>Where do we look for news? How do we communicate with each other? Should 
    our developer communication be on lugnet legOS news group? -- we've a number 
    of communications concerns:
    <UL>
      <LI>IMHO I think we should use all the sourceforge services we have 
      available when we have a need for them. When it comes to public questions 
      / feedback / announcements then we should post to the lugnet legOS group. 
      <LI>To date, we have four posting mechanisms: (1) Bugs, (2) Support 
      Requests, (3) Patches and (4) Feature Requests. We also have a email list 
      archive/repeater. We can and should communicate to all of us developers 
      simply by <BR>sending email to 'brickos-devel@lists.sourceforge.net'. 
    </LI></UL>
    <LI>{more ???} </LI></UL><A name=issuesResolved>
  <H3><FONT color=#800000>RESOLVED Issues</FONT></H3></A>The following issues 
  have been resolved for one reason or another as indicated by each issue.
  <UL>
    <LI>The <B>TCP patch</B> will take some time to restructure as build-time 
    option 
    <UL>
      <LI>I've already received an important vote that this be left out as it is 
      not central to legOS in order to drive the RCX and communicate with it. It 
      is a fun effort and some important work in terms of tiny code implementing 
      a TCP stack but may not be right for us 
      <LI><B>RESOLUTION: This patch will not be included in a brickOS release.</B> 
      </LI></UL></LI></UL><A name=numbering>
  <H3>Test Version Numbering</H3></A>Our current numbering scheme was started 
  when legOS was started. We have a problem, now, in that we would like create 
  minor releases but the field is already in use as our current releases are all 
  minor (our major number is zero). So, to keep this simple we'll number by 
  adding another minor digit to the right with a thought to maybe we reset the 
  numbering (go to 1.0.0?) when we move to our new name.
  <P>We are building semi-public test releases of what will eventually be called 
  0.2.6 followed by 0.2.7. To this end we will number these early versions as 
  offshoots of the prior release 0.2.5 or 0.2.6 as appropriate by using 0.2.5.x 
  numbering (or 0.2.6.x numbering) where the 'x' will be incremented with each 
  test release. <I>I thought about using .alphaX or .testingX but i then thought 
  we should keep this as simple as possible.</I>
  <P>Our goal in addressing this is to ensure that all of our public releases 
  increase in number so various installers will know that each release replaces 
  the earlier release. Installers that react to this today are: Debian GNU/Linux 
  package manager (.deb's) and the Red Hat package manager (.rpm's).<A name=docs>
  <H3>Documentation</H3></A>Our current HOWTO (sgml) needs to remain the 
  cornerstone of our documentation. It, however, does need to be freshened. We 
  also have a newer HOWTO-cygwin (sgml) which needs to be updated. Likewise, we 
  want to add the generated API documentation.
  <P>Not all of this is in our current source tree (CVS) it needs to be added. 
  Make rules need to be added to generate the HTML docs from the source as well 
  as to generate a doc-only distribution tarball. This would allow our users to 
  install legOS and optionally install the supporting documentation.<A 
  name=packaging>
  <H3>Packaging Desires</H3></A>Certainly our final release will be packaged in 
  at least the forms we've used to date. That is a source tarball. Red Hat RPMs 
  and a Debian GNU/Linux package. I have no experience with the windows version 
  but if we created a package/tarball for it we will do that for this release as 
  well.
  <P>We should also package in a couple of these forms for each testing release 
  so that will will be able to install and test a rapidly as we can.
