<h1>The brickOS Homepage</h1>
<P><B>brickOS</B> is the new name for the project formerly known as legOS.</p>

<h2>So what is brickOS?</h2>
<p>brickOS is an Open Source project that provides a C and C++ programming environment 
for the Lego Mindstorms Robotics Kits, allowing the owner of such a kit to program 
in good old-fashioned C (or C++) instead of the standard Lego Programming Language. It was
originally developed on Linux, but should run on most Unices as well as Windows.</p>

<h2>Docs</h2> 
<p>All brickOS documentation is now linked to from <a href="http://legos.sourceforge.net/docs/">the docs page</a> 
here at Sourceforge. There, you'll find links to the HOWTO, API docs, and everything 
else that you'll need to get started working with brickOS.</p>

<h2>Files</h2> 
<p>The current version of brickOS (0.2.6) is available from our
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/legos">brickOS project development page (here)</a> 
If that version gives you problems, our two prior versions are (0.2.5)  
<a href="http://legos.sourceforge.net/files/common/brickOS-0.2.5.tar.gz">here.</a> and (0.2.4) 
<a href="http://legos.sourceforge.net/files/common/brickOS-0.2.4.tar.gx">here</a>.</p> 

<p>Most crucial brickOS files, including windows and linux compilers and installation 
instructions, are now mirrored at sourceforge in the <a href="http://legos.sourceforge.net/files/">files</a> subdirectory. </p>

<h2>Development</h2> 
For details on brickOS at sourceforge, try 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/legos">the development page</a>
.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2> 
For discussion on brickOS, try the (for now, legos) newsgroup at 
lugnet: <a href="http://lugnet.com/robotics/rcx/legos/">lugnet.robotics.rcx.legos</a>. This is definitely the best place to get brickOS questions answered ASAP.</p> 

<p>Most of all, remember: Have fun.</p>
