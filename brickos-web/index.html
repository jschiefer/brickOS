<em>The brickOS project is in transition from our original name legOS to our 
new name <B>brickOS</b>.  During this transition you will find links to our prior site (links with 
legos name in them) and install files still being distributed using our prior name.  It will take
some time for this all to change to our new name.  So, we ask for your patience while we make this
change.  Thank you. -brickOS Team</em>

<h2>So what is brickOS?</h2>
<p>brickOS is an Open Source project that provides a C and C++ programming environment 
for the Lego Mindstorms Robotics Kits, allowing the owner of such a kit to program 
in good old-fashioned C (and now C++) instead of the standard Lego Programming Language. It was
originally developed on Linux, but should run on most Unices as well as Windows.</p>

<p>brickOS consists of an alternative operating system for the Mindstorms RCX and demonstration
programs written in C and C++.  Also provided are utilities which allow you to download the OS
to the RCX and download your compiled programs to the RCX.

<p>The brickOS distribution provides the sources for the operating system, the demo programs and the
utilities.   You will also need an Hitachi H8 cross compiler assembler and linker (basic toolchain). 
Our instructions, referred to in the following <B>Docs</B> section, help you obtain and configure these
tools.  After they are installed you will be able to build the OS, the utilities and finally, 
programs for controlling your own creations.</p>

<h2>Docs</h2> 
<p>All brickOS documentation is now linked to from <a href="http://legos.sourceforge.net/docs/">the docs page</a> 
here at Sourceforge. There, you'll find links to the HOWTO, API docs, and everything 
else that you'll need to get started working with brickOS.</p>

<h2>Files</h2> 
<p>The current version of brickOS (0.2.6) is available from our
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/legos">brickOS project development page (here)</a> 
If that version gives you problems, our two prior versions are (0.2.5)  
<a href="http://legos.sourceforge.net/files/common/brickOS-0.2.5.tar.gz">here.</a> and (0.2.4) 
<a href="http://legos.sourceforge.net/files/common/brickOS-0.2.4.tar.gx">here</a>.</p> 

<p>Most crucial brickOS files, including windows and linux compilers and installation 
instructions, are now mirrored at sourceforge in the <a href="http://legos.sourceforge.net/files/">files</a> subdirectory. </p>

<h2>Development</h2> 
For details on brickOS at sourceforge, try 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/legos">the development page</a>
.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2> 
For discussion on brickOS, try the (for now, legos) newsgroup at 
lugnet: <a href="http://lugnet.com/robotics/rcx/legos/">lugnet.robotics.rcx.legos</a>. This is definitely the best place to get brickOS questions answered ASAP.</p> 

<p>Most of all, remember: Have fun.</p>
