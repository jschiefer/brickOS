  <h2>Feedback</h2>
  <p>We are offering release candidates in order to get more testing against 
  them than we can do by ourselves. This means that we need your testing results 
  as soon as you can report them. Likewise our goal is to address what you are 
  seeing as quickly as possible and get the next release candidate out. It is 
  also useful for you to tell us it works for the platform and compiler tools 
  you were using (of course, tell us what these are ;-)</p>
