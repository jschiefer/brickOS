This is dllx, a slightly modified version of dll for lnpd & lilnp.
At least on my old 486, it looks a little more reliable than the original dll
when running with 4800 baud. I haven´t tested it at 2400 baud, hopefully it
works.

To compile, adjust the 2 defines at the top of the Makefile, and make depend;
make all.
