TODO list for lnpd 
------------------

 - choose the working version of lnpdll(x) and kill the other!
 - add manpage for lnpdll (or lnpdllx) whichever is real
 - kill off the lnpdllx name
 - ensure lnpdll uses similar options for stuff that would be in dll(1)
 - add USB tower support to daemon 
 - distribute lnptest and lnptest2 sources with example make file as example
 - move more of the README content to the lnpd(8) manpage

 I'll prototype the following in the Debian package and as I get them 
 finalized I will add them to the lnpd package -stephen

 - add start script for lnpd (for /etc/init.d use)
 - add defaults file for lnpd start script (for placing in /etc/default)
 - iff needed add configuration script for lnpd (to be /etc/lnpd.conf)
